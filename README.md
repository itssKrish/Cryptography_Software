# What is cryptography? 

The method of transforming ordinary plain language into cryptic text and vice versa is known as cryptography.

# Importance of Cryptography 

The use of computer systems, the internet, and wireless communication is constantly expanding. At the moment, hundreds of thousands of users transfer  data via a computer network. However, one of the most essential issues while sending data between client and server is safety. There are numerous ways available to protect data from incredibly vulnerable attackers, in that cryptography is among the most popular technology

# Types of Cryptography Keys 

there are two types of encryption keys: 

1. Symmetric Key & 2. Asymmetric Key. 

In Symmetric Encryption with a secret key the communication is encrypted, and the same key is used to decrypt it, making it simple to use but less secure.
Whereas Asymmetric Key Encryption is a technique that uses both  public and private keys to encrypt data,it encrypts and decrypts the message using two separate 
keys. Although it is more effective than symmetric key encryption but substantially slower.

Among them for better security, we have chosen a symmetric key encryption method in this project.

# Algorithm Used 

AES is the most secure and popular technique. It offers great long-term protection against brute-force attacks. The AES algorithm allows a key length of 128/192/256 bits. Its most popular application is in Wi-Fi,it may also be used in various programming languages,So, in the given proposed system, we have used the AES algorithm with the help of python programming language.

# Avability 

The software comes in two different versions geek and non-geek 

In the geek version, you can download the source code and can use it directly without any installation.
whereas in the non-geek version there are again two versions 1. Installer and 2. Non-installer versions, both can be used without installing Python or any of its libraries.
